# NaiveBayes-NeuralNetwork

### Overview
This was part of a college machine learning assignment. In this, we implemented Naive Bayes and Neural Network from scratch without using any existing libraries.

The dataset and the detailed analysis of the comparison between these techniques are also uploaded for reference. For each of the models, different techniques, like normalization, missing values, etc., were also implemented to check the effect of each technique on different models.
Naive Bayes results were also compared with techniques like logistic regression and KNN.
